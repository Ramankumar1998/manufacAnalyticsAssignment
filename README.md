### Data Visualization Task

1. You are expected to calculate some statistical measures of the Wine Data Set.
2. In the final product, upon running yarn start, the browser should open with the desired
page rendered.
3. No other helper libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, Lodash, etc. should be used.
4. Remove all the unused code (JS, CSS, Test Files, etc) and libraries from the CRA template
to reduce clutter.

5. Please perform the following:
`a`. Write utility functions to calculate the class-wise mean, median, mode of
“Flavanoids” for the entire dataset.
i. The “Class” of alcohol is denoted by the “Alcohol” property.

ii. All these measures should be calculated by you without the help of any
3rd party libraries.

iii. All these 3 properties should be displayed as a React component in a
tabular format as shown below:

`b`. Write a function that helps you create a new property “Gamma” for each point of
the dataset. “Gamma” can be calculated as Gamma = (Ash * Hue) / Magnesium.
Thereafter, calculate the class-wise mean, median, mode of “Gamma” for the
entire dataset.

i. Again, show this data as a React Component in the following tabular

6. No further analysis or any sort of textual summary of data/results is needed.
7. The final calculated values (mean, median, mode) should be rounded off to 3 decimal
places.
